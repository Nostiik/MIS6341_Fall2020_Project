# MIS6341_Fall2020_Project
Contains the classification project undertaken during the Fall 2020 semester in MIS6341 Machine Learning class at UT Dallas.

This was a project with a group of 2 which required two separate datasets - one for classification, another for regression. My portion of the project conducted analysis on the classification dataset; for this project I used a fictitious dataset created by IBM to analyze.
