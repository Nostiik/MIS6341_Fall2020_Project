# MIS6341_Fall2020_Project
This repo contains the classification portion of my project undertaken during the Fall 2020 semester in MIS6341 Machine Learning class at UT Dallas.

This project required my group (group of 2) to use two separate datasets; one dataset was used for regression and the other dataset was used for classification. My teammate and I split the work; I worked on the classificiation portion of this assignment. For this project, I used a fictitious dataset created by IBM targeted at understanding employee attrition. 

The Project_1 folder contains the project requirements and classification project. This project required applying classification models, analyzing their results and finding the best fitting model for the dataset.
